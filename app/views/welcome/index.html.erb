  <p>A local bike shop or local bicycle shop is a small business specializing
     in bicycle sale, maintenance and parts. The expression distinguishes small
     bicycle shops from large chains and mail-order or online vendors is
     abbreviated LBS. In the UK and Ireland, the expression independent
     bicycle dealers (IBDs) is also used.
     The local bike shop is a key component of the bicycle industry and, in recognition of the value that local bike shops provide, some manufacturers only sell their bicycles through dealerships.
